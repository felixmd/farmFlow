# AGRO-COOPERATIVE EXPORT GUIDELINES (2025 EDITION)
**Document ID:** EXP-2025-CHILI-01
**Subject:** Approved Pesticides and Residue Limits for Export-Grade Chili
**Region:** Global Export Standards (EU/US/Middle East)

## 1. MARKET CLASSIFICATIONS & PRICING
Farmers must choose a production track. Mixing tracks will result in lot rejection.

| Grade Category | Target Market | Price Benchmark | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grade A (Premium)** | Export (EU, UK, USA) | **$2.50 - $3.00 / kg** | **ZERO RESIDUE** of Red-List chemicals. Must pass Lab Test LC-MS/MS. |
| **Grade B (Standard)** | Domestic Supermarkets | **$1.20 - $1.50 / kg** | Low residue. Green/Yellow Label chemicals allowed. |
| **Grade C (Local)** | Local Mandi / Paste | **$0.40 - $0.60 / kg** | No specific residue limits (High volume, low value). |

> **WARNING:** If a batch intended for Grade A fails the lab test due to Banned Chemical traces, it is automatically downgraded to Grade C. There is no intermediate option. The financial loss is approx **80%**.

## 2. THE "RED LIST" (BANNED SUBSTANCES)
**Strictly Prohibited for Grade A (Export) Chili.**
These chemicals are effective at killing pests but persist in the fruit, causing immediate rejection at customs.

* **Chemical:** Imidacloprid (Trade names: Confidor, Tata Mida)
    * *Why Banned:* High persistence. Exceeds Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) of 0.01 ppm.
    * *Common Farmer Mistake:* Using this for Thrips near harvest.
* **Chemical:** Acephate (Trade names: Asataf)
    * *Why Banned:* Neurotoxic potential. Banned in EU.
* **Chemical:** Profenofos
    * *Why Banned:* Causes failed lab tests even 45 days after spraying.
* **Chemical:** Chlorpyrifos
    * *Why Banned:* Global ban in progress due to health risks. Immediate export rejection.

## 3. THE "GREEN LIST" (RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES)
**Approved for Grade A (Export) Chili.**
These are organic or low-residue options that ensure the crop passes lab tests.

### Target Pest: Thrips (Leaf curling, upward boat shape)
* **Do NOT use:** Imidacloprid / Fipronil
* **RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:**
    1.  **Sticky Traps:** Install 40 Blue Sticky Traps per acre.
    2.  **Bio-Spray:** Use **Spinosad** (45 SC) @ 0.3ml/liter OR **Neem Oil** (10,000 ppm) @ 2ml/liter.
    3.  **Wait Period:** 3 days before harvest.

### Target Pest: Fruit Borer (Holes in chili pods)
* **Do NOT use:** Chlorpyrifos / Profenofos
* **RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:**
    1.  **Pheromone Traps:** Install 10 *Helicoverpa* lures per acre.
    2.  **Bio-Spray:** Use **Emamectin Benzoate** (5 SG) @ 0.4g/liter OR **Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)** spray.
    3.  **Wait Period:** 5 days before harvest.

### Target Pest: Mites (Downward curling leaves)
* **Do NOT use:** Dicofol
* **RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:**
    1.  **Bio-Spray:** Use **Sulphur 80 WP** (water soluble) @ 3g/liter.
    2.  **Organic:** Dashparni Ark (Herbal extract).

## 4. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
If a farmer has *already* sprayed a Red List chemical by mistake:
1.  **Identify:** Mark the specific rows sprayed.
2.  **Segregate:** Do not harvest these rows with the main export batch.
3.  **Delay:** Wait minimum **60 days** before harvesting for local markets.
4.  **Notify:** Inform the Cooperative Field Officer immediately to cancel the Lab Test booking (saving $150 testing fee).
